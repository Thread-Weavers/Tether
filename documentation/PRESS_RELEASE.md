## 😞 The Problem 
Many people have experienced a mental health issue that makes them feel isolated, overwhelmed, and insecure. In many places, talking about these issues or dealing with them is difficult for the person going through them. Many become afraid to confide in their loved ones, and even afraid to confide in a therapist. What some are looking for is a third party, one disconnected from everything to help keep them accountable and help vent through issues they just need to let out!

## 📝 Summary
Especially since COVID, loneliness has been at an all-time high. In recent years, around 1-in-2 adults report experiencing loneliness. A 2019 survey shows that 25% of adults from ages 18-27 reported having no close friends, with a staggering 22% claiming to have no friends at all (Cherry, 2023). All of this while lockdowns and social distancing measures made it even harder for people to maintain in-person connections. However, due to this, many individuals have turned to online spaces as a way to fill the gap for these interactions. While face-to-face interactions still seem to be the most ideal, studies have shown that digital communication still provides meaningful interactions that help combat loneliness (Sun et al., 2022).

## 🤔 Our Hypothesis
If people are paired with an accountability partner (other users seeking help for mental health challenges) in a supportive app environment, then they are more likely to maintain their mental health and feel less isolated during their recovery journey.

## 📱 Product Overview 
Our app will allow users to set up a profile where they can list their mental health routines, therapy appointments, and any other information they feel comfortable adding. Users will have to check their own list off as routines happen to start staying accountable. If you happen to miss your routines one day, your accountability partner can nudge you and see if you want to chat! This would be a completely anonymous interaction, and must be agreed on by both parties first. 

## 🏙️ Mission Statement 
Our mission is to foster meaningful connections among individuals struggling with mental health challenges, providing accountability while reducing feelings of loneliness and enhancing overall well-being.

## 🫂 Who do we serve?
We serve people struggling with mental health or isolation but do not want to have an official meeting with a therapist.
