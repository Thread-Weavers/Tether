### 🚀 Problem Statement

Many individuals experience mental health issues that leave them feeling isolated and overwhelmed, especially in the aftermath of COVID-19. With a significant portion of adults reporting feelings of loneliness, our application targets those who seek a safe space to connect with others facing similar challenges. By offering an anonymous support platform, we aim to bridge the gap between isolation and meaningful interaction, helping users maintain their mental health through accountability and community support.
